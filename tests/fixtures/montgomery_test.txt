Analysis of Informed Consent Requirements in UK Medical Law

The landmark case of Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11 established important principles regarding informed consent in medical treatment.

The Supreme Court held that doctors have a duty to inform patients of material risks associated with proposed treatments. This duty extends beyond what a responsible body of medical practitioners might consider appropriate disclosure.

Key Points from Montgomery:

1. The Supreme Court ruled that informed consent requires doctors to disclose material risks to patients, enabling them to make informed decisions about their treatment.

2. The case involved a diabetic mother who was not informed about the risk of shoulder dystocia during vaginal delivery, which resulted in serious injuries to her child.

3. The Court rejected the Bolam test for informed consent, instead adopting a patient-centered approach that focuses on what a reasonable person in the patient's position would want to know.

4. Justice Kerr emphasized that the therapeutic exception (withholding information for the patient's benefit) should be narrowly construed and only applied in exceptional circumstances.

This decision represents a significant shift in UK medical law, moving from a paternalistic model to one that respects patient autonomy and the right to make informed choices about medical treatment.

The Montgomery judgment cited earlier authority including Sidaway v Board of Governors [1985] AC 871 and drew on comparative jurisprudence from other common law jurisdictions.
